Need to be able to track:
- absolute location
- absolute orientation
- when device rotates
- when device moves
- speed of rotation

How often do we need to poll to be accurate?

Make macros to send specific signal depending on the sensor measurements:
- scroll
- mouse click
- mouse movement

Do we need to implement asyncronous polling?


CONNECTIVITY:
Bluetooth:
- I have no idea how such a connection works
- I assume that we have to establish a connection
- send messages via that connection

WiFi:
- Same as bluetooth??
